# Coding Standards

## Python Conventions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller functions.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- Mention external dependencies and their purpose in comments.

## Style and Formatting

- Follow PEP 8.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Keep line length at 79 characters.
- Place docstrings immediately after `def` or `class`.
- Use blank lines between functions and classes where appropriate.

## Testing Expectations

- Include test cases for critical paths.
- Cover edge cases like empty inputs and invalid data types.
- Document test cases with docstrings explaining intent.
