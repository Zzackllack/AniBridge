## Summary

- No content hosting or endorsement. Torznab/qBittorrent endpoints are compatibility shims; metadata is synthetic for automation.
- User responsibility. Verify that your usage complies with copyright laws, anti‑circumvention rules, and site policies where you live.
- No legal advice. Laws vary widely by jurisdiction and change over time.
- Third‑party services. Respect robots.txt, rate limits, and access controls. Do not bypass DRM/TPMs, paywalls, or CAPTCHAs.
- Privacy and networking. Prefer a system‑level VPN (e.g., Gluetun) over per‑request proxies for reliability. See Guide → Networking.
