Came across a repository that addresses the domain rotation problem with an automated approach: [https://github.com/Yezun-hikari/new-domain-check](https://github.com/Yezun-hikari/new-domain-check). It regularly checks for domain changes (e.g., TLD swaps for services like *megakino*) and tracks the current valid domain using a GitHub Actions workflow.

This could potentially be reused or adapted so that AniBridge doesn’t rely on a hardcoded *megakino* URL. Instead, we might be able to fetch a dynamically updated domain list or lookup file (e.g., raw `domain.txt`) generated by that action at runtime.

It’s not a full solution yet, but seems like a promising starting point.
